      summary: Get all weather stations associated with your API Key
      description: >
        Returns data for all weather stations associated with the API Key passed
        in the query parameters.  Currently all stations are returned in a
        single response.  A future enhancement will provide pagination to reduce
        the size of the response.  The fields listed below are returned for each
        station; additionally, a **generated_at** field is returned for the
        entire response, containing a Unix timestamp of the time the response
        was returned by the server.
