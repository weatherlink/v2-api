We have created a WeatherLink Developers Discord to serve as a central location for API related chat and support with dedicated channels for each WeatherLink API. The Discord is monitored by the Davis Instruments/WeatherLink engineers responsible for the WeatherLink APIs. Feel free to ask your questions and report any issues you have.

You can join the WeatherLink Developers Discord at [https://weatherlink.github.io/v2-api/discord]

## Gitter Chat Room (Deprecated)

<div class="notice--warning">
<h4>Please Note:</h4>
<p>Gitter is quite limited in features and having to maintain multiple individual chat rooms for each API is a burden. For this reason we have created the WeatherLink Developers Discord mentioned above and it will be the new primary API support chat system. The Discord server has dedicated channels for each WeatherLink API making it a single location for all WeatherLink API support chat.</p>
<p>We are not closing the Gitter chat room yet, but we are asking that new questions and conversations take place on Discord.</p>
</div>

We have set up a dedicated support chat room for WeatherLink v2 API users.

The chat room is monitored by the Davis Instruments/WeatherLink engineers responsible for the v2 API. Feel free to ask your questions and report any issues you have with the v2 API.

Keep in mind other people will also be in the chat room so please be careful and do not post your API Secret in the chat.

The chat room is available at <a href="https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/v2-api">https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/v2-api</a>
